**Type:** 🎤 Talk | **Relevance Score:** 51.97%

**⏰ Time:** 11:15am – 11:30am

**👥 Authors (7 total):** Romain Lopez*, Emma Dann*, Jeffrey Spence, Mineto Ota, Aviv Regev, Alex Marson, Jonathan Pritchard

**📝 Abstract:**

Understanding how genetic variants affect complex traits through intermediate molecular mechanisms remains a fundamental challenge in human genetics. While rare-variant burden analyses and CRISPR screens identify genes that influence phenotypes, the underlying molecular pathways mediating these effe...

### Single-cell Transcriptome-wide Association Study Identifies Cell-Type-Specific Genes for Lung Cancer

**Type:** 🎤 Talk | **Relevance Score:** 50.61%

**⏰ Time:** 1:45pm – 2:00pm

**👥 Authors (8 total):** Yaohua Yang, Qingying Chen, Stephen S. Rich, Ani W. Manichaikul, David F. Kashatus, Todd W. Bauer, Xiaobo Zhou, Yongjun Liu ASHG 2025 Annual Meeting Platform Abstracts

**📝 Abstract:**

Background: Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have uncovered over 100 putative risk genes for lung cancer. However, most of these studies relied on bulk RNA-seq data with limited resolution of cell-type-specific genetic effects on gene expression and lung cancer risk. Methods: We conduct...
